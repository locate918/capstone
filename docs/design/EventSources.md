## Notes for Skylar

When evaluating a source, check:
1. Does it have a clean events listing page?
2. Is there an API available? (easier than scraping)
3. Does robots.txt allow scraping?
4. How often is it updated?
5. What event types does it cover?

### API Priority
- Eventbrite has a public API - USE THIS FIRST
- Bandsintown has an API
- Most venue sites require HTML scraping

### Scraping Tips
- Start with ONE source, get it working end-to-end
- Use the LLM `/api/normalize` endpoint to parse messy data
- Store `source_url` for every event - we link back to organizers
- Check for duplicates (same event on multiple sites)
